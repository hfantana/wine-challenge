    "In this challenge, we will build a predictive model to answer the question **\"What makes a wine good or bad?\"**. We will use a real data set of 1599 red Vinho Verde wine samples from the northern Portugal (add link to data set). Our data includes a number of variables that come from chemical tests and a variable `Quality` which is a score from 1-10 given by experts. Our hypothesis is that chemical properties contribute to wine quality and therefore make a wine \"good\" or \"bad\", and we want to create model that can predict the quality of previously unseen wines. \n",

    "To do so we will first explore our data set and create some visualizations to gather some insights about which varaibles int he data set might contribite to wine quality. We will then, create a model using a part of the data set and evaluate it to determine how effective the model would be at predciting wine wulaity when given previously unseen wines. \n",
